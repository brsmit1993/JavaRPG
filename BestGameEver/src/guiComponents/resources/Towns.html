<h2>
-Towns have their own unique names. Towns tend to be safer then other locations. <br>
-The events that occur in towns are sometimes dangerous but not very.<br>
-Monsters you encounter are also the weakest you will encounter in the game.<br>
-Ideally until you become more powerful towns are the best places to gain XP and loot.<br>
