<h2>
-There are a variety of different items in the game. Stats potions boost your stats by 1 point. <br>
-These potions are extremely rare though so feel lucky when you find one. <br>
-HP and SP potions give you a little HP and SP back up to your max. <br>
-These are the most common items you'll find. The rarest items are the GPS and Map. <br>
-The map displays every location on the map but is a bit useless with out the GPS. <br>
-The GPS gives your current location based on Cord-X and Cord-Y. <br>
