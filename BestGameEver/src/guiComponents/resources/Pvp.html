<h2>
-The only major difference in the PVP battle system is that instead of a monster <br>
-automatically attacking the second player in the battle decides there move. <br>
-PVP is initiated when two players end up on the same block of the map. <br>
-If either player dies the battle ends. If there is only one player left alive. The game ends. <br>
