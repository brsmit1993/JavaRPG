<h2>
-There are two different types of events. <br>
-The first is a random chance event. These events do not allow you to make a decision and sort them selves out. <br>
-The second is a choice event. These events allow you to make one of three decisions. <br>
-Both events have 3 possible different outcomes. Generally speaking most events have one bad, one good, and<br>
-one neutral outcome. How ever in some cases a good out come might become bad if you fail the stat check. <br>
-The stat check essentially says if your certain stat isn't high enough then the event becomes bad. <br>
-Some events reward XP, others increase a random stat, and some give random items. <br>
-If the out come is bad though then you'll take damage or lose a stat instead. <br>
-The neutral outcome does nothing. <br>
